default = ["underline-color", "crossterm_0_29"]

#! One of the following versions of crossterm must be enabled. By default, the latest version is
#! enabled. This will always default to the most recent version of crossterm, but you can override
#! this by specifying the version you want to use in your Cargo.toml file. The purpose of these
#! features is to allow widget libraries to depend on specific versions of crossterm in a way that
#! doesn't cause version conflicts. A compiler error will be raised if you don't enable at least one
#! of the following features.

## Enables crossterm 0.28.x
crossterm_0_28 = ["dep:crossterm_0_28"]
## Enables crossterm 0.29.x
crossterm_0_29 = ["dep:crossterm_0_29"]

#! The following features are optional and can be enabled to add additional functionality to the
#! library. These features are not required for the library to function, but they may be useful in
#! certain situations.

## Enables serde for crossterm dependency
serde = ["crossterm_0_28?/serde", "crossterm_0_29?/serde"]

## enables the backend code that sets the underline color.
## Underline color is not supported on Windows 7.
underline-color = ["ratatui-core/underline-color"]

## Use terminal scrolling regions to make Terminal::insert_before less prone to flickering.
scrolling-regions = ["ratatui-core/scrolling-regions"]

#! The following features are unstable and may change in the future:

## Enable all unstable features.
unstable = ["unstable-backend-writer"]

## Enables getting access to backends' writers.
unstable-backend-writer = []
