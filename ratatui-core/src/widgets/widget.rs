/// A `Widget` is a type that can be drawn on a [`Buffer`] in a given [`Rect`].
///
/// Prior to Ratatui 0.26.0, widgets generally were created for each frame as they were consumed
/// during rendering. This meant that they were not meant to be stored but used as *commands* to
/// draw common figures in the UI.
///
/// Starting with Ratatui 0.26.0, all the internal widgets implement Widget for a reference to
/// themselves. This allows you to store a reference to a widget and render it later. Widget crates
/// should consider also doing this to allow for more flexibility in how widgets are used.
///
/// In Ratatui 0.26.0, we also added an unstable [`WidgetRef`] trait and implemented this on all the
/// internal widgets. In addition to the above benefit of rendering references to widgets, this also
/// allows you to render boxed widgets. This is useful when you want to store a collection of
/// widgets with different types. You can then iterate over the collection and render each widget.
/// See <https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/issues/1287> for more information.
///
/// In general where you expect a widget to immutably work on its data, we recommended to implement
/// `Widget` for a reference to the widget (`impl Widget for &MyWidget`). If you need to store state
/// between draw calls, implement `StatefulWidget` if you want the Widget to be immutable, or
/// implement `Widget` for a mutable reference to the widget (`impl Widget for &mut MyWidget`) if
/// you want the widget to be mutable. The mutable widget pattern is used infrequently in apps, but
/// can be quite useful.
///
/// A blanket implementation of `Widget` for `&W` where `W` implements `WidgetRef` is provided.
/// Widget is also implemented for `&str` and `String` types.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use ratatui::{
///     backend::TestBackend,
///     widgets::{Clear, Widget},
///     Terminal,
/// };
/// # let backend = TestBackend::new(5, 5);
/// # let mut terminal = Terminal::new(backend).unwrap();
///
/// terminal.draw(|frame| {
///     frame.render_widget(Clear, frame.area());
/// });
/// ```
///
/// It's common to render widgets inside other widgets:
///
/// ```rust
/// use ratatui_core::{buffer::Buffer, layout::Rect, text::Line, widgets::Widget};
///
/// struct MyWidget;
///
/// impl Widget for MyWidget {
///     fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer) {
///         Line::raw("Hello").render(area, buf);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
pub trait Widget {
    /// Draws the current state of the widget in the given buffer. That is the only method required
    /// to implement a custom widget.
    fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer)
    where
        Self: Sized;
}

/// Renders a string slice as a widget.
///
/// This implementation allows a string slice (`&str`) to act as a widget, meaning it can be drawn
/// onto a [`Buffer`] in a specified [`Rect`]. The slice represents a static string which can be
/// rendered by reference, thereby avoiding the need for string cloning or ownership transfer when
/// drawing the text to the screen.
impl Widget for &str {
    fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer) {
        self.render_ref(area, buf);
    }
}

/// Renders a `String` object as a widget.
///
/// This implementation enables an owned `String` to be treated as a widget, which can be rendered
/// on a [`Buffer`] within the bounds of a given [`Rect`].
