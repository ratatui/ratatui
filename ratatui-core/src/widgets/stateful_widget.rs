/// A `StatefulWidget` is a widget that can take advantage of some local state to remember things
/// between two draw calls.
///
/// Most widgets can be drawn directly based on the input parameters. However, some features may
/// require some kind of associated state to be implemented.
///
/// For example, the `List` widget can highlight the item currently selected. This can be translated
/// in an offset, which is the number of elements to skip in order to have the selected item within
/// the viewport currently allocated to this widget. The widget can therefore only provide the
/// following behavior: whenever the selected item is out of the viewport scroll to a predefined
/// position (making the selected item the last viewable item or the one in the middle for example).
/// Nonetheless, if the widget has access to the last computed offset then it can implement a
/// natural scrolling experience where the last offset is reused until the selected item is out of
/// the viewport.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use std::io;
///
/// use ratatui::{
///     backend::TestBackend,
///     widgets::{List, ListItem, ListState, StatefulWidget, Widget},
///     Terminal,
/// };
///
/// // Let's say we have some events to display.
/// struct Events {
///     // `items` is the state managed by your application.
///     items: Vec<String>,
///     // `state` is the state that can be modified by the UI. It stores the index of the selected
///     // item as well as the offset computed during the previous draw call (used to implement
///     // natural scrolling).
///     state: ListState,
/// }
///
/// impl Events {
///     fn new(items: Vec<String>) -> Events {
///         Events {
///             items,

///         // the selection as well as the stored offset.
///         self.state = ListState::default();
