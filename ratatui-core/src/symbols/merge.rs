//! This module provides strategies for merging symbols in a layout.
//!
//! It defines the [`MergeStrategy`] enum, which allows for different behaviors when combining
//! symbols, such as replacing the previous symbol, merging them if an exact match exists, or using
//! a fuzzy match to find the closest representation.
//!
//! The merging strategies are useful for [collapsing borders] in layouts, where multiple symbols
//! may need to be combined to create a single, coherent border representation.

/// A strategy for merging two symbols into one.
///
/// This enum defines how two symbols should be merged together, allowing for different behaviors
/// when combining symbols, such as replacing the previous symbol, merging them if an exact match
/// exists, or using a fuzzy match to find the closest representation.
///
/// This is useful for [collapsing borders] in layouts, where multiple symbols may need to be
/// combined to create a single, coherent border representation.
///
/// Not all combinations of box drawing symbols can be represented as a single unicode character, as
/// many of them are not defined in the [Box Drawing Unicode block]. This means that some merging
/// strategies will not yield a valid unicode character. The [`MergeStrategy::Replace`] strategy
/// will be used as a fallback in such cases, replacing the previous symbol with the next one.
///
/// Specifically, the following combinations of box drawing symbols are not defined in the [Box
/// Drawing Unicode block]:
///
/// - Combining any dashed segments with any non dashed segments (e.g. `╎` with `─` or `━`).
/// - Combining any rounded segments with any other segments (e.g. `╯` with `─` or `━`).
/// - Combining any double segments with any thick segments (e.g. `═` with `┃` or `━`).
/// - Combining some double segments with some plain segments (e.g. `┐` with `╔`).
///
/// The merging strategies include:
///
/// - [`Self::Replace`]: Replaces the previous symbol with the next one.
/// - [`Self::Exact`]: Merges symbols only if an exact composite unicode character exists, falling
///   back to [`Self::Replace`] if not.
/// - [`Self::Fuzzy`]: Merges symbols even if an exact composite unicode character doesn't exist,
///   using the closest match, and falling back to [`Self::Exact`] if necessary.
///
/// See [`Cell::merge_symbol`] for how to use this strategy in practice, and
/// [`Block::merge_borders`] for a more concrete example of merging borders in a layout.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use ratatui_core::symbols::merge::MergeStrategy;
///
/// assert_eq!(MergeStrategy::Replace.merge("│", "━"), "━");
/// assert_eq!(MergeStrategy::Exact.merge("│", "─"), "┼");
/// assert_eq!(MergeStrategy::Fuzzy.merge("┘", "╔"), "╬");
