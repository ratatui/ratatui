#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! `widgets` is a collection of types that implement [`Widget`] or [`StatefulWidget`] or both.
//!
//! Widgets are created for each frame as they are consumed after rendered.
//! They are not meant to be stored but used as *commands* to draw common figures in the UI.
//!
//! The available widgets are:
//! - [`Block`]: a basic widget that draws a block with optional borders, titles and styles.
//! - [`BarChart`]: displays multiple datasets as bars with optional grouping.
//! - [`calendar::Monthly`]: displays a single month.
//! - [`Canvas`]: draws arbitrary shapes using drawing characters.
//! - [`Chart`]: displays multiple datasets as a lines or scatter graph.
//! - [`Clear`]: clears the area it occupies. Useful to render over previously drawn widgets.
//! - [`Gauge`]: displays progress percentage using block characters.
//! - [`LineGauge`]: display progress as a line.
//! - [`List`]: displays a list of items and allows selection.
//! - [`Paragraph`]: displays a paragraph of optionally styled and wrapped text.
//! - [`Scrollbar`]: displays a scrollbar.
//! - [`Sparkline`]: display a single data set as a sparkline.
//! - [`Table`]: displays multiple rows and columns in a grid and allows selection.
//! - [`Tabs`]: displays a tab bar and allows selection.
//!
//! [`Canvas`]: crate::widgets::canvas::Canvas

/// A `Widget` is a type that can be drawn on a [`Buffer`] in a given [`Rect`].
///
/// Prior to Ratatui 0.26.0, widgets generally were created for each frame as they were consumed
/// during rendering. This meant that they were not meant to be stored but used as *commands* to
/// draw common figures in the UI.
///
/// Starting with Ratatui 0.26.0, all the internal widgets implement Widget for a reference to
/// themselves. This allows you to store a reference to a widget and render it later. Widget crates
/// should consider also doing this to allow for more flexibility in how widgets are used.
///
/// In Ratatui 0.26.0, we also added an unstable [`WidgetRef`] trait and implemented this on all the
/// internal widgets. In addition to the above benefit of rendering references to widgets, this also
/// allows you to render boxed widgets. This is useful when you want to store a collection of
/// widgets with different types. You can then iterate over the collection and render each widget.
/// See <https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/issues/1287> for more information.
///
/// In general where you expect a widget to immutably work on its data, we recommended to implement
/// `Widget` for a reference to the widget (`impl Widget for &MyWidget`). If you need to store state
/// between draw calls, implement `StatefulWidget` if you want the Widget to be immutable, or
/// implement `Widget` for a mutable reference to the widget (`impl Widget for &mut MyWidget`) if
/// you want the widget to be mutable. The mutable widget pattern is used infrequently in apps, but
/// can be quite useful.
///
/// A blanket implementation of `Widget` for `&W` where `W` implements `WidgetRef` is provided.
/// Widget is also implemented for `&str` and `String` types.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use ratatui::{
///     backend::TestBackend,
///     widgets::{Clear, Widget},
///     Terminal,
/// };
/// # let backend = TestBackend::new(5, 5);
/// # let mut terminal = Terminal::new(backend).unwrap();
///
/// terminal.draw(|frame| {
///     frame.render_widget(Clear, frame.area());
/// });
/// ```
///
/// It's common to render widgets inside other widgets:
///
/// ```rust
/// use ratatui::{buffer::Buffer, layout::Rect, text::Line, widgets::Widget};
///
/// struct MyWidget;
///
/// impl Widget for MyWidget {
///     fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer) {
///         Line::raw("Hello").render(area, buf);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
pub trait Widget {
    /// Draws the current state of the widget in the given buffer. That is the only method required
    /// to implement a custom widget.
    fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer)
    where
        Self: Sized;
}

/// A `StatefulWidget` is a widget that can take advantage of some local state to remember things
/// between two draw calls.
///
/// Most widgets can be drawn directly based on the input parameters. However, some features may
/// require some kind of associated state to be implemented.
///
/// For example, the [`List`] widget can highlight the item currently selected. This can be
/// translated in an offset, which is the number of elements to skip in order to have the selected
/// item within the viewport currently allocated to this widget. The widget can therefore only
/// provide the following behavior: whenever the selected item is out of the viewport scroll to a
/// predefined position (making the selected item the last viewable item or the one in the middle
/// for example). Nonetheless, if the widget has access to the last computed offset then it can
/// implement a natural scrolling experience where the last offset is reused until the selected
/// item is out of the viewport.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use std::io;
///
/// use ratatui::{
///     backend::TestBackend,
///     widgets::{List, ListItem, ListState, StatefulWidget, Widget},
///     Terminal,

///     // item as well as the offset computed during the previous draw call (used to implement
///     // natural scrolling).
