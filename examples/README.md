# Examples

This folder contains examples that are more app focused. There are also other examples in example
folders under each crate folder e.g. [ratatui examples], [ratatui-widgets examples].

[ratatui examples]: ../ratatui/examples
[ratatui-widgets examples]: ../ratatui-widgets/examples

You can run these examples using:

```shell
cargo run -p example-name
```

This folder might use unreleased code. Consider viewing the examples in the `latest` branch instead
of the `main` branch for code which is guaranteed to work with the released ratatui version.

> [!WARNING]
>
> There may be backwards incompatible changes in these examples, as they are designed to compile
> against the `main` branch.
>
> There are a few workaround for this problem:
>
> - View the examples as they were when the latest version was release by selecting the tag that
>   matches that version. E.g. <https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/v0.26.1/examples>.
> - If you're viewing this file on GitHub, there is a combo box at the top of this page  which
>   allows you to select any previous tagged version.
> - To view the code locally, checkout the tag. E.g. `git switch --detach v0.26.1`.
> - Use the latest [alpha version of Ratatui] in your app. These are released weekly on Saturdays.
> - Compile your code against the main branch either locally by adding e.g. `path = "../ratatui"` to
>   the dependency, or remotely by adding `git = "https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui"`
>
> For a list of unreleased breaking changes, see [BREAKING-CHANGES.md].
>
> We don't keep the CHANGELOG updated with unreleased changes, check the git commit history or run
> `git-cliff -u` against a cloned version of this repository.
