/// A Ratatui example that demonstrates how to handle panics in your application.
///
/// Prior to Ratatui 0.28.1, a panic hook had to be manually set up to ensure that the terminal
/// was reset when a panic occurred. This was necessary because a panic would interrupt the
/// normal control flow and leave the terminal in a distorted state.
///
/// Starting with Ratatui 0.28.1, the panic hook is automatically set up by the new
/// `ratatui::init` function, so you no longer need to manually set up the panic hook. This
/// example now demonstrates how the panic hook acts when it is enabled by default.
///
/// When exiting normally or when handling `Result::Err`, we can reset the terminal manually at
/// the end of `main` just before we print the error.
///
/// Because a panic interrupts the normal control flow, manually resetting the terminal at the
/// end of `main` won't do us any good. Instead, we need to make sure to set up a panic hook
/// that first resets the terminal before handling the panic. This both reuses the standard
/// panic hook to ensure a consistent panic handling UX and properly resets the terminal to not
/// distort the output.
///
/// That's why this example is set up to show both situations, with and without the panic hook,
/// to see the difference.
///
/// For more information on how to set this up manually, see the [Color Eyre recipe] in the
/// Ratatui website.
///
/// This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently
/// reading. See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui
/// release.
