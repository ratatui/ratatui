[features]
#! The crate provides a set of optional features that can be enabled in your `cargo.toml` file.
#!
## By default, we enable the crossterm backend as this is a reasonable choice for most applications
## as it is supported on Linux/Mac/Windows systems. We also enable the `underline-color` feature
## which allows you to set the underline color of text.
default = ["crossterm", "underline-color"]
#! Generally an application will only use one backend, so you should only enable one of the following features:
## enables the [`CrosstermBackend`] backend and adds a dependency on the [Crossterm crate].
crossterm = ["dep:crossterm"]
## enables the [`TermionBackend`] backend and adds a dependency on the [Termion crate].
termion = ["dep:termion"]
## enables the [`TermwizBackend`] backend and adds a dependency on the [Termwiz crate].
termwiz = ["dep:termwiz"]

#! The following optional features are available for all backends:
## enables serialization and deserialization of style and color types using the [Serde crate].
## This is useful if you want to save themes to a file.
serde = ["dep:serde", "bitflags/serde"]

## enables the [`border!`] macro.
macros = []

## enables all widgets.
all-widgets = ["widget-calendar"]

#! Widgets that add dependencies are gated behind feature flags to prevent unused transitive
#! dependencies. The available features are:
## enables the [`calendar`] widget module and adds a dependency on the [Time crate].
widget-calendar = ["dep:time"]

#! Underline color is only supported by the [`CrosstermBackend`] backend, and is not supported
#! on Windows 7.
## enables the backend code that sets the underline color.
underline-color = ["dep:crossterm"]

#! The following features are unstable and may change in the future:

## Enable all unstable features.
unstable = ["unstable-segment-size", "unstable-rendered-line-info"]

## Enables the [`Layout::segment_size`](crate::layout::Layout::segment_size) method which is experimental and may change in the
## future. See [Issue #536](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/issues/536) for more details.
unstable-segment-size = []

## Enables the [`Paragraph::line_count`](crate::widgets::Paragraph::line_count)
## [`Paragraph::line_width`](crate::widgets::Paragraph::line_width) methods
## which are experimental and may change in the future.
## See [Issue 293](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/issues/293) for more details.
