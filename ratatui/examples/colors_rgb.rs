//! crates.io, or the one that you have installed locally.

// This example shows the full range of RGB colors that can be displayed in the terminal.
//
// Requires a terminal that supports 24-bit color (true color) and unicode.
//
// This example also demonstrates how implementing the Widget trait on a mutable reference
// allows the widget to update its state while it is being rendered. This allows the fps
// widget to update the fps calculation and the colors widget to update a cached version of
// the colors to render instead of recalculating them every frame.
//
// This is an alternative to using the `StatefulWidget` trait and a separate state struct. It
// is useful when the state is only used by the widget and doesn't need to be shared with
// other widgets.
