/// A `StatefulWidgetRef` is a trait that allows rendering a stateful widget by reference.
///
/// This is the stateful equivalent of `WidgetRef`. It is useful when you need to store a reference
/// to a stateful widget and render it later. It also allows you to render boxed stateful widgets.
///
/// This trait was introduced in Ratatui 0.26.0. It is currently marked as unstable as we are still
/// evaluating the API and may make changes in the future. See
/// <https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/issues/1287> for more information.
///
/// A blanket implementation of `StatefulWidgetRef` for `&W` where `W` implements `StatefulWidget`
/// is provided. Most of the time you will want to implement `StatefulWidget` against a reference to
/// the widget instead of implementing `StatefulWidgetRef` directly.
///
/// See the documentation for [`WidgetRef`] for more information on boxed widgets. See the
/// documentation for [`StatefulWidget`] for more information on stateful widgets.
///
